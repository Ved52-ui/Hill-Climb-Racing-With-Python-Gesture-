## 🧠 How It Works

This project uses:

- 📷 **OpenCV** – for webcam access  
- ✋ **MediaPipe** – for palm detection and hand tracking  
- 🎮 **Pynput** – to simulate keyboard presses (for gas and brake)

By detecting your **palm state (open or closed)**, it simulates:
- **Open palm** → Press the **gas (right arrow)** key
- **Closed fist** → Press the **brake (left arrow)** key
